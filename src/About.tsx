                        applying my knowledge of hardware to build computers as a hobby and playing PC games with friends.
                        Some of favourite games i've played in the past are <a id="text-link" href="https://www.nomanssky.com"> No Mans Sky </a> & both <a id="text-link" href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news?game=subnautica"> Subnautica games. </a>

                        Right now, i'm making my own projects in order to constantly iterate on my skills to become a better developer.
