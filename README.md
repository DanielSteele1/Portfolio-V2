- This version uses Vite instead of CRA, which should reduce loading time on users and during development.
- It will look much more professional than my current website, adhering to modern design principles.
- The code uses TypeScript to be more modular in nature as opposed to just using code JS, which ensures a cleaner code structure. (Right now, my current website has just one JS & CSS file).
